# tm-agenda-maker âš¡

> This project is still in beta

tm-agenda-maker is a project made to simplify toastmaster meeting agendas. With polling and other management options, club managers can cruise through making the agenda.

With the hassle of meeting roles taken away, club managers can now focus on what really matters to them - the quality.

## Startup

```
